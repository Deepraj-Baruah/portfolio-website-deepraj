<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello my name is Deepraj Baruah i am from Guwahati, Assam, india i am very passionate about my work. Because I love what I do, I have a 
   steady source of motivation that drives me to do my best. In my last job, this passion led me to challenge myself daily and learn 
   new skills that helped me to do better work. I have completed my schooling from Capital Public School and Bachelor degree in computer science 
   from Gauhati University, Guwahati, Assam and i know how to build websites and as well as how to design that particular websites. 
   I soon became the go-to person for any design needs.</p>

<p>I am ambitious and driven. I thrive on challenge and constantly set goals for myself, so I have something to strive towards.
   I am not comfortable with settling, and I am always looking for an opportunity to do better and achieve greatness.</p>

<p>I am a people person. I love meeting new people and learning about their lives and their backgrounds.
   I can almost always find common ground with strangers, and I like making people feel comfortable in my presence. 
   I find this skill is especially helpful when kicking off projects with new clients.</p>
